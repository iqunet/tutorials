### Introduction
Waste management plants rely on serial processing lines where failures
cause significant capacity loss due to limited redundancy. This makes some
level of predictive maintainance monitoring critical to prevent downtime.

While PLCs are in the control of the pipeline, machine manufacturers
treat health monitoring mostly as an afterthought, leaving it to the customers
to handle failures. In unhealthy environments filled with dust, humidity, and
noise, daily manual inspections are not practical.

In this blogpost, we will explore how ruggedized wireless vibration sensors
and machine learning provide regular health updates, enabling early detection
of issues. We shall cover the technical setup, the data processing, and the
machine learning which automate the anomaly detection in noisy environments.
Noisy, in this case, refers to the sensor signal, which is polluted with
unwanted vibrations from the production process itself, in addition to the
machine defects we are trying to detect here.
